Version 0.2 of the AnDrupal toolkit

Current Status:
Working implementation of andrupal-api for almost all fetch functionality (e.g. saves don't yet work).

UPDATE 2010-Oct-25: The name will be changing.  To what, we're not sure, but stay tuned!

Build Instructions
------------------

Step 1: Download the Android SDK
Download it from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html.

For the purposes of this install, we assume it was extracted at /opt/android-sdk

In your ~/.bashrc, add the following two lines:

export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk
export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/bin"

To activate this change, run:

source ~/.bashrc

Step 2: Download maven

You can get maven from http://maven.apache.org/.  We assume it's installed in /opt/maven.

Add it to your path by modifying .bashrc so the above lines read:

export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk
export M2_HOME=/opt/maven
export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/bin:$M2_HOME/bin"

Step 3: Build the project

Note: You will need an Android Virtual Device configured.  By default the project looks for an AVD
called "EVO4G."  You can change this in andrupal-publisher/pom.xml.

Go to your project directory in terminal (e.g. the directory you found this readme in).

Run:

mvn install

To deploy to your virtual device:

mvn android:deploy

TODO: Implement save functionality
TODO: Implement getComment functionality
TODO: Work out UI side of things.
