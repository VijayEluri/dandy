Version 0.3 of the Dandy toolkit

Current Status:
Working implementation of dandy-api for almost all fetch functionality (e.g. saves don't yet work).

UPDATE 2010-Dec-07:

Drupal Dandy module now included in github.  This includes a couple of views (via features) that
are used by the default Dandy-Publisher reference implementation.

Issue discovered when serializing nodes that aren't assigned to a taxonomy.  This is an issue where Drupal serializes
the taxonomy field as an empty array when no taxonomy exists, but as an object when they do. Fixed.

UPDATE 2010-Dec-06:

The new name for AnDrupal is Dandy.  Git repo data updated as well.  We also now
have support for fetching individual comments, all comments for a node, as well as preliminary CCK support.  We've also
added support on drupalServicesRequestManager for passthru of file data (such as images) so that the publisher app can display
images provided by cck imagefield.


Build Instructions
------------------

Step 1: Download the Android SDK
Download it from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html.

For the purposes of this install, we assume it was extracted at /opt/android-sdk

In your ~/.bashrc, add the following two lines:

export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk
export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/bin"

To activate this change, run:

source ~/.bashrc

Step 2: Download maven

You can get maven from http://maven.apache.org/.  We assume it's installed in /opt/maven.

Add it to your path by modifying .bashrc so the above lines read:

export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk
export M2_HOME=/opt/maven
export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/bin:$M2_HOME/bin"

Step 3: Build the project

Note: You will need an Android Virtual Device configured.  By default the project looks for an AVD
called "EVO4G."  You can change this in dandy-publisher/pom.xml.

Go to your project directory in terminal (e.g. the directory you found this readme in).

Run:

mvn install

To deploy to your virtual device:

mvn android:deploy

TODO: Implement "read it later" functionality.

This works in a test container, but for SQLite on android is throwing invalid constraint exceptions.

TODO: new comment screen

Functionality for save comment works in test container, needs to be implemented in UI for publisher.

TODO: upload file

Ability to attach an image to a node (this is of course pending the ability to actually post a node)

TODO: support for Services 3.x branch and Drupal 7.
